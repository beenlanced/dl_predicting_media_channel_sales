## Project Description

This project came out of the [LinkedIn Learning course: Deep Learning and Generative AI with Python: Data Processing and Analytics](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/deep-learning-and-generative-ai-data-prep-analysis-and-visualization-with-python)

The goal of the project is take raw marketing telecommunication data from a fictitious company and build a predictive model for media sales. Essentially, this is a typical machine learning project which gets an extra zhuzh by building the model using a deep learning/neural network model and making a web accessible application to provide access to the predicative model.

### What this Project Does Specifically

The project

- Loads and inspects the marketing telecommunication data
- Preprocesses/cleans the data
- Performs Exploratory Data Analysis
- Creates a deep learning network to build the prediction model
- Conducts analysis of the predictive model results
- Makes any improvements
- Makes the predicative model accessible via a web application

---

## Objective

The project contains the key elements:

- `Deep Learning` for neural networks building,
- `FastAPI` to render the app,
- `Git` (version control),
- `Httpx` to help make async HTTP requests
- `Jupyter` python coded notebooks,
- `Keras` to build autoencoder and layers,
- `Matplotlib` visualization of spaces,
- `Numpy` for arrays and numerical operations,
- `Python` the standard modules,
- `Pydantic` to define structure of incoming request body and validate input data,
- `Scikit-Learn` for PCA and TSNE modules and to get training and test datasets,
- `TensorFlow` to build autoencoder and layers

## Getting Started

Here are some instructions to help you set up this project locally.

---

## Installation Steps

The Python version used for this project is `Python 3.11` to be compatible with TensorFlow.

Follow the requirements for using TensorFlow [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#macos)

use `uv pip install tensorflow`

- Make sure to use python versions `Python 3.9‚Äì3.12
- pip version 19.0 or higher for Linux (requires manylinux2014 support) and Windows. pip version 20.3 or higher for macOS.
- Windows Native Requires Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019

### Clone the Repo

1. Clone the repo (or download it as a zip file):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/beenlanced/ai_learning_visualizing_latent_spaces.git
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment named `.venv` using `uv` Python version 3.11:

   ```bash
   uv venv --python=3.11
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment: `.venv`

   On macOs and Linux:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate #mac
   ```

   On Windows:

   ```bash
    # In cmd.exe
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   ```

4. Install packages using `pyproject.toml` or (see special notes section)

   ```bash
   uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
   ```

   or alternatively with the `requirements.txt` file

   ```bash
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Install the Jupyter Notebook `visualizing_latent_space.ipynb`

1. **Run the Project**

   - Run `visualizing_latent_space.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook UI or in VS code.

   run the FastAPI application from your terminal:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   then open a web browser and got to

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000
   ```

---

## Special Notes

- Including`requirements.txt` file as there are unique considerations when using the `TensorFlow` library. Plus, just in case you run into issues wth the `pyproject.toml` file there is the ability to use the requirements file as well to build the virtual environment.

- Running this notebook took approximately 25 minutes to run using an Apple M4 Pro with macOS Sequoia. Depending on the processor(s) that you are running this time will vary.

### Final Words

Thanks for visiting.

Give the project a star (‚≠ê) if you liked it or if it was helpful to you!

You've `beenlanced`! üòâ
